    "# Analysis of Healthcare Payment Data for the Top 25 Costliest Drugs in the United States (2021-2022)\n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this project, we focused on analyzing different patterns in the cost of the top 25 costliest drugs in the United States from the period between 2021 and 2022. The motivation behind our project is to allow people to understand what factors (such as drug category and payer type) influence prescription drug costs the most. Healthcare costs are a massive burden to the U.S. population, and documentation that supports laymen understanding of healthcare billing is scarce. As such, creating a project that models and visualizes what influences the costs of the most expensive drugs in the U.S. has value in that it provides insight into what routes of obtaining necessary medication are most affordable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description and Cleanup Practices\n",
    "The data that we are using is from the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/healthcare-payments-data-hpd-fee-for-service-drug-costs). This is a composite dataset breaking down the top 25 most expensive drugs by payer type, drug category, and the type of information collected on each drug (median, frequency, cost, etc.). To make the data more digestible and manageable for analysis, we broke the composite dataset into a variety of separate datasets each determined by one analysis type (freq, cost, median) and table type, which provides tables based on overall costs, regular payers, and payers excluding MediCal. Each of these smaller datasets are more easily referenceable. \n",
